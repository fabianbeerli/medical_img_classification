Project Motivation
Skin cancer ranks among the most prevalent forms of cancer globally, with its incidence steadily rising. Timely detection and accurate diagnosis of skin lesions are critical for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes.
The primary motivation behind this project is to develop a machine learning-based system capable of accurately classifying skin lesions as either cancerous(malignant) or benign. By automating the diagnostic process, the aim is to provide healthcare professionals with a reliable tool that can assist in early detection and prompt intervention for suspected cases of skin cancer.
Skin cancer represents a significant public health challenge, affecting millions of individuals worldwide each year. However, access to specialized dermatological care for timely diagnosis may be limited, especially in underserved communities. By creating an automated system for skin lesion classification, the project seeks to address this gap in access to healthcare services, potentially saving lives through early detection and intervention.
The project's relevance lies in its ability to utilize advanced technology to address a critical healthcare need. By leveraging machine learning and computer vision techniques, the system aims to democratize access to skin cancer diagnosis, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare disparities.
