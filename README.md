# Skin Cancer Classification Project

## Project Motivation:

Skin cancer ranks among the most prevalent forms of cancer globally, with its incidence steadily rising. Timely detection and accurate diagnosis of skin lesions are critical for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. The primary motivation behind this project is to develop a machine learning-based system capable of accurately classifying skin lesions as either cancerous (malignant) or benign. By automating the diagnostic process, the aim is to provide healthcare professionals with a reliable tool that can assist in early detection and prompt intervention for suspected cases of skin cancer. Skin cancer represents a significant public health challenge, affecting millions of individuals worldwide each year. However, access to specialized dermatological care for timely diagnosis may be limited, especially in underserved communities. By creating an automated system for skin lesion classification, the project seeks to address this gap in access to healthcare services, potentially saving lives through early detection and intervention. The project's relevance lies in its ability to utilize advanced technology to address a critical healthcare need. By leveraging machine learning and computer vision techniques, the system aims to democratize access to skin cancer diagnosis, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare disparities.

## Interpretation and Validation of Skin Cancer Classification Models:

Upon training and evaluating three distinct models for skin cancer classification – a custom model, ResNet50, and VGG16 – it's evident that the performance varies significantly based on the model architecture and the amount of training data available. The purpose of this section is to interpret the results obtained, reflect on the impact of specific choices made during the process, and discuss the validation of these results.

### Interpretation of Results:

- **Custom Model:** Initially trained with limited data, the custom model achieved an accuracy of approximately 65%. However, when trained with a larger dataset, its performance significantly improved, reaching an impressive accuracy of over 97%. This underscores the importance of data quantity in model performance, as observed in the significant improvement from the initial 65% to over 97% accuracy.

- **ResNet50 and VGG16:** In comparison, both pre-trained models – ResNet50 and VGG16 – exhibited lower accuracy, approximately 47%. Due to time constraints, these models were not trained with a larger dataset to assess their full potential. It's important to note that the performance of ResNet50 and VGG16 could potentially improve with more extensive training data.

### Impact of Specific Choices:

- **Data Quantity:** The most significant impact on model performance was observed with the amount of training data. Increasing the dataset size from a limited set to a more comprehensive one resulted in a substantial improvement in accuracy for the custom model. However, due to constraints such as computing power and time limitations, it was not feasible to regenerate the model with over 90% accuracy.

- **Model Architecture:** The choice of model architecture also played a crucial role. While pre-trained models offer the advantage of transfer learning, they may not always perform optimally on specific datasets. In contrast, a custom model tailored to the dataset's characteristics showed superior performance when provided with sufficient training data.

### Validation of Results and Comparison with Benchmarks:

To evaluate the performance of the skin cancer classification models, comparisons were made with existing benchmarks and industry standards. While there is no universally accepted benchmark for skin cancer classification, several studies have reported accuracies ranging from 70% to over 90% for similar tasks using various datasets and methodologies.

The custom model, when trained with a larger dataset, achieved an impressive accuracy of over 97%, surpassing many reported benchmarks in the literature. This indicates that the custom model has the potential to achieve state-of-the-art performance when provided with sufficient training data.

In contrast, the pre-trained models, ResNet50 and VGG16, exhibited lower accuracies of approximately 47%. However, it's essential to note that these models were not trained with a larger dataset due to time constraints. With additional training data and fine-tuning, their performance could potentially approach or even surpass existing benchmarks in skin cancer classification tasks.

While the models' accuracies provide valuable insights into their performance, it's essential to consider other metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score for a more comprehensive evaluation. Further validation against established benchmarks and real-world clinical data would enhance confidence in the models' efficacy and generalizability.

Overall, the results obtained demonstrate promising progress in automated skin cancer classification, indicating the potential for machine learning-based systems to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing and treating skin lesions more effectively. Continued research and development in this field are crucial for further advancing the state of the art and improving patient outcomes in dermatology.


- **Limitations:** Unfortunately, the model with over 90% accuracy was overwritten due to constraints, preventing further validation or comparison against other benchmarks. This limitation highlights the importance of preserving successful model iterations for future reference and analysis. Additionally, it should be noted that the VGG16 model was mistakenly stored from the pgm in the custom_model.keras file, which could have impacted its performance.

### Conclusion:

In conclusion, the interpretation and validation of skin cancer classification models underscore the significance of data quantity and model architecture in achieving optimal performance. While pre-trained models offer convenience, custom models tailored to specific datasets can outperform them when provided with sufficient training data. However, constraints such as computing resources and time limitations can hinder the ability to fully explore and validate model performance, emphasizing the need for careful planning and resource management in machine learning projects.
